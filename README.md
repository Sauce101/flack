## What is flask-SocketIO?
see [flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

> Flask-SocketIO gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server. The client-side application can use any of the SocketIO official clients libraries in Javascript, C++, Java and Swift, or any compatible client to establish a permanent connection to the server.

## Overview
Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. Also send private messages via an alert. If you disconnect, Flack will remember your username and channel you were on. Channel history is also remembered. (100 most recent messages).
